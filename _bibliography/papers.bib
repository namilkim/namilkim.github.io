  title={How Does AI Improve Human Decision-Making? Evidence from the AI-Powered Go Program},
  author={Choi, Sukwoong and Kang, Hyo and Kim*, Namil and Kim, Junsik},
  year={current},
  abstract={We study how humans learn from AI, exploiting an introduction of an AI-powered Go program (APG) that unexpectedly outperformed the best professional player. We compare the move quality of professional players to that of APG’s superior solutions around its public release. Our analysis of 749,190 moves demonstrates significant improvements in players’ move quality, accompanied by decreased number and magnitude of errors. The effect is pronounced in the early stages of the game where uncertainty is highest. In addition, younger players and those in AI-exposed countries experience greater improvement, suggesting potential inequality in learning from AI. Further, while players of all levels learn, less skilled players derive higher marginal benefits. These findings have implications for managers seeking to adopt and utilize AI effectively within their organizations.},

  title={How Digital Platforms Unintentionally Foster Entrepreneurial Activities: The Case of the Staggered Entry of Craigslist},
  author={Daehyun Kim and Namil Kim* and Yongwook Paik},
  year={current},
  abstract={The emergence of prominent digital platforms impacts the way we organize economic activities, including how one starts a new business. In this paper, we examine how a prominent digital platform might affect entrepreneurial activities. We argue that popular digital platforms that serve as a peer-to-peer digital marketplace such as Craigslist can lower barriers to entrepreneurship by reducing resource acquisition costs and customer acquisition costs when starting new businesses, resulting in increased entrepreneurial activities. Exploiting the staggered entry of Craigslist into various U.S. markets with a difference-in-differences econometrics approach, we find causal evidence that the entry of Craigslist increased local entrepreneurial activity, especially in low-income regions and for business-to-consumer businesses. Our study highlights the unintentional spillover effect of a digital platform in empowering potential entrepreneurs.},

  abstract={We study how the physical effects of climate change motivate entrepreneurs to develop and protect climate change adaptation (CCA) intellectual property (IP) in heterogeneous ways across countries. Integrating the sustainable entrepreneurship literature with the attention-based view, we show that country-level climate impact redirects managerial attention to the disruptive potential of climate change and spurs the sector into action to pursue and protect CCA-related IP. We also find that strong intellectual-property rights regulations and environmental movements in countries strengthen this effect. Our results extend the sustainable entrepreneurship literature by showing how the geography of climate impact explains how CCA IP protection efforts are distributed globally.},

  journal={Technological Forecasting and Social Change},
  volume={180},
  pages={121688},
  year={2022},
  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={Previous studies on changes in industrial leadership, called “catch-up cycles,” focused on the critical role of technological disruption in the efforts by latecomers to forge ahead. However, we have recently witnessed leadership changes even in technologically mature sectors, such as industrial equipment, without technological discontinuity. To investigate changes in industrial leadership in these sectors, we propose a conceptual framework that emphasizes the role of modularization as a technology ladder for latecomers to narrow the technological gap with the frontier, institution-led market discontinuity by governments, and latecomers’ market development strategies. With this framework, we analyzed successive leadership changes in the Chinese excavator market, from Japan to Korea in the early and mid-2000s and from Korea to China after 2010. We advance our understanding of the catch-up phenomenon in business and society by describing the implications involved in latecomers’ leadership in mature sectors from a “non-Schumpeterian” perspective.},

  abstract={International strategic alliances (ISAs) are an important strategic tool for local firms, and management scholars have long been interested in determining their drivers, such as brokerage positions, using social network theory. However, the different types of brokerage positions in competition networks have been underexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we theorize that the information benefits of a brokerage position in competition networks are constrained, and this may significantly influence the alliance formation of a firm. In studying the U.S. telecommunications equipment manufacturing industry, we observe that as firms enter brokerage positions in competition networks, ISAs, particularly upstream ISAs, become more likely to form. Our findings imply that the properties of competition networks motivate local firms to search for external resources to decipher the codification or tacitness of information access from competitors.},

  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={Suppliers are concerned about the extent of customer concentration, which creates supplier’s operating efficiency (benefit) as well as major customer’s bargaining power (cost). When these suppliers are SMEs with resource deficiency, they are more concerned with how to balance this trade-off. Regarding the problem, we study the relationship between customer concentration and supplier profitability and the moderating role of insider ownership, the fraction of equity owned by firm’s insiders, on the relationship. We find that concentration by major customers has a U-shaped relationship with supplier profitability, and this relationship is attenuated as insider ownership increases. This implies that insider ownership can attenuate the bargaining power of major customers and strengthen the operating efficiency of suppliers. Our findings provide relevant evidence on the costs and benefits of concentration by major customers as well as theorize the moderating role of insider ownership from the perspectives of interest alignment and collaborative relationship marketing.},

  pages={38--48},
  year={2018},
  publisher={Elsevier},
  abstract={The advent of social commerce has resulted in a new business model for e-commerce. Although studies on this business model have increased over time, they have paid less attention to its core business model: consumer-generated social influence on sales on a social commerce site. Therefore, in this paper, we examine the effect on sales of social sharing, such as Facebook “likes” and Twitter tweets, which generate social influence, using data from major social commerce companies. We find that consumer-generated social referrals regarding deals significantly boost sales in social commerce. When we examine deals involved in national sales, this finding holds only for Facebook but not for tweets. These findings have the implication for managers that not all social referrals are meaningful in increasing sales for their business.},

  abstract={Which kind of government intervention is needed to transform scientific and technological knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship? We answer this question by drawing upon the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and institutional theory. We empirically examined the moderating effect of government intervention on the relation between knowledge and innovative nascent entrepreneurship with cross-country panel data on 47 countries from 2002 to 2012. Our results first show that a smaller government sector is required to transform technological knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship. In addition, we found that a larger government sector and more regulation of credit, labor, and business increase the transformation of scientific knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship. We contribute to understanding the role of government in transforming scientific and technological knowledge into innovative nascent entrepreneurship.},

  abstract={In the renewable energy industry, technology development requires a large initial investment by firms and takes a long time. Thus, protecting patents in this industry has become an increasingly important issue in maintaining a company's value. In this study, we examine how patent protection affects firms’ market value by analyzing the listed companies in South Korea in the renewable energy sector over a 35-year period (from 1980 to 2014). We find that simple patent counts are not a strong measure for explaining a firm's financial success in this industry, whereas indices that represent a firm's ability to protect patents (backward citation and patent family) positively and significantly affect the firm's market value. This study suggests that patent protection is an important factor for companies in improving their economic value in the renewable energy sector.},

  abstract={Because of the accelerated life cycle in technology and correspondingly rapid technological saturation in markets, firms are not only accelerating the rate of technological innovation but also expanding the scope of their products or services by combining product or service features of other markets, which eventually leads to industry convergence. However, despite the significant impact of industry convergence on the economy, our understanding of the phenomenon is still limited because previous studies explored only a few cases and come largely from the technological perspective. Therefore, it is still questionable whether industry convergence is a general phenomenon that is prevalent across entire industries. In this paper, we analyze the phenomenon in entire U.S. industries, focusing on its trends and patterns. To do so, we conduct a co-occurrence-based analysis of text mining for a large volume of unstructured data – 2 million newspaper articles from 1989 to 2012 – and suggest using an industry convergence (IC) index based on normalized pointwise mutual information (PMI). We find that overall industry convergence is increasing over time. Moreover, the rate of the increase has been greater within industry than between industries at a given industry level. However, when we cluster the dynamic patterns of industry convergence among industry pairs, the patterns are mixed, and, while some industry groups are converging over time, others are stationary. These findings suggest that significant transformation is under way in the economy, but this phenomenon is not yet prevalent across entire industries. In addition, this study provides a method for anticipating the future direction of industry convergence.},
