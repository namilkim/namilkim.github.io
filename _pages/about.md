### Welcome!

I am **Namil Kim**, an assistant professor at the [Department of Advanced Industry Fusion](https://aif.konkuk.ac.kr), [Konkuk University](https://www.konkuk.ac.kr/sites/en/index.do). 


- My research interests encompass topics within strategic management, innovation, and entrepreneurship. 
  - I have carried out studies on industry dynamics, firms' innovation performance, and the influence of socio-economic factors on entrepreurial activities.
  - Lately, I have also developed an interest in the economics of digitization and AI. 
  - In particular, some of my current work-in-progress projects explore how digitization and AI transform decision-making, knowledge discovery, collaborative efforts, and the utilization of new products.

 financial market quality and portfolio allocation.

In one of my projects, I theoretically document and provide supportive empirical evidence for a novel driver of passive investing: falling costs to fundamental information. In other ongoing work, I study the implications of quantitative mutual funds and exchange traded products to market quality.



The key question in my research is how firms strategically manage their innovation processes and outcomes in response to ever-changing business environments.
I explore three different types of competition and how relevant policies reshape firm innovation strategies.
Product market competition
Competition for labor forces, and
Competition for innovation and intellectual property rights
